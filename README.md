# Chess board simulation using Python (Minimax & Alpha-beta pruning)
First attempt is using minimax algorithm but as minimax(minimax.py) is an ad-hoc process and takes every simulation in account second approach is using Apha-beta pruning (alphabeta.py).

This implementation imports the chess class from here : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-chess
To install the same 
\n sudo pip install python-chess
